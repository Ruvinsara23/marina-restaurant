<h1>Our Story</h1><br></br>
<p>

Milano is a family-owned and operated restaurant that has been serving up authentic Italian cuisine since 1970. Our story began when our grandparents, Maria and Giovanni, immigrated to the United States from Italy. They were determined to share their love of food and culture with their new home, so they opened a small restaurant in their neighborhood.</p>

<p>Maria and Giovanni's cooking was a hit, and soon Milano became a popular destination for locals and tourists alike. Their secret ingredients were simple: fresh, high-quality ingredients and a passion for cooking</p>.
